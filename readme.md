#Community for News organizations

##Questions

I write this in 2015, and it is remarkable to me how old many of these essays are.  It feels in part as though we've passed on beyond community, like it's a missed opportunity.  True? -- LW


## Where did this come from?  

This is an offshoot of [Do Read The Comments](https://github.com/lisawilliams/doreadthecomments), a similar collection specifically about reforming and reclaiming comments from their current slough of despond.

## Can I add to this?  

Yes, absolutely.  Here are some instructions on how to add to this repository: [Here's a beginner's guide](https://nerds.inn.org/2015/03/17/contributing-to-the-inn-nerds-docs-repo-using-github-com/). Just substitute this repository for the one used as an example in the tutorial.  

If that feels like too much, you can just click [Issues](https://github.com/lisawilliams/community/issues/new) and let me know what's on your mind.  You'll need a (free) Github account to do so.  

If that still feels like too much, summon me on the Twitter, where I am [@lisawilliams](http://twitter.com/lisawilliams).

*"We search for new business models that involve paywalls, more video, the iPad, and wealthy donors, while the most powerful emerging business driver in the new economy is community."*

*For that effort, API will create a flexible “toolkit” for putting on a news organization-run community event that discusses a local issue, including an event guide and flexible program.*

*This shock of inclusion, where professional media gives way to participation by two billion amateurs (a threshold we will cross this year) means that average quality of public thought has collapsed; when anyone can say anything any time, how could it not? If all that happens from this influx of amateurs is the destruction of existing models for producing high-quality material, we would be at the beginning of another Dark Ages...So it falls to us to make sure that isn't all that happens.*

*The long-term sustainability of local news depends on deepening journalists’ engagement with communities. Through shifts in technology, economics and newsroom processes, the public has become increasingly central to journalism as creators, consumers and collaborators.*

*Creating in-roads for community participation and giving people more power to contribute to local journalism efforts is complex and time intensive. However, the end result can be a public that is more engaged in their communities and in supporting local news.*

*Engagement is the job of every journalist, Meg says, but her primary contacts in the newsroom are folks called community coordinators. They’re spread around the desks in the newsroom, focused on content areas. Their job is basically to be a bridge between editor and user. They’re part host, part researcher, part social media manager, part evangelist for user ideas.*

*Appropriately, a lot of what we teach in journalism school is about the craft of gathering information and telling stories.*

*But too often missing is a discussion of who it’s all for.*

*Who wants it?*
*Who is it helping?*
*Who will seek it out?*
*Who will pay for it?*
*Who gets to decide what “good journalism” is?*

***If we want a future full of relevant, well-funded journalism, we have to be teaching students to ask those questions.***

*(Have decided that I must basically read every post on Joy Mayer's blog -- LW)*

*But there’s opportunity within the empty quadrants – how could users/readers get involved before publication? And how could staff/journalists continue to be involved following publication?*
